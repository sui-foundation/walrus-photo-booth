Welcome to the Walrus Photo Booth (the “Application”). By using the Application, you (“User” or “you”) agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before proceeding. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Application.

## 1. Consent to Photograph & Release
By using the Application to capture photographs, you consent to be photographed and grant the Walrus Foundation (“Walrus,” “we,” or “us”) permission to store, display, and distribute your photos on the website, www.walrusphotoboth.com (the “Website”), and as further outlined in these Terms. You affirm that you have the authority to grant this consent and that any individuals appearing in the photos also consent to such use.

## 2. Public Display & Decentralized Storage
All photos taken using the Application will be stored on Walrus, a decentralized storage network, and will be publicly viewable by anyone accessing the network, including the Website. As Walrus operates on decentralized storage, photos cannot be modified, deleted, or restricted after they have been uploaded. By using the Application, you acknowledge and accept that your photos will be permanently stored and publicly available.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, your photo may be removed from the Website. If you wish to remove your photo from the website, please contact notices@walrus.xyz. 

## 3. License to Use Photographs
By using the Application, you grant Walrus a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, publicly display, and create derivative works from your photos for promotional, marketing, and other lawful purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, use in social media, advertisements, printed materials, websites, and other digital or physical marketing channels.

## 4. User Responsibilities
You agree not to upload any photos that contain unlawful, offensive, defamatory, or inappropriate content (“Abusive Material”). You further affirm that you have obtained necessary permissions from all individuals depicted in the photos and that your submission does not violate any third-party rights, including intellectual property or privacy rights.
We reserve the right to take down any photos from the Website that we deem to be Abusive Material.

## 5. No Expectation of Privacy
Because all photos are stored on a decentralized, publicly accessible network, you acknowledge that you have no expectation of privacy concerning any photos uploaded through the Application. Walrus is not responsible for how third parties access, use, or share publicly available photos.

## 6. Disclaimer of Liability
Walrus is not responsible for any misuse of photos stored on its decentralized network. By using the Application, you release Walrus and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from any liability related to the public display, access, or use of your photographs by third parties.
Walrus does not guarantee uninterrupted operation of the Application or the security of stored photos and is not responsible for any loss or unauthorized access due to factors beyond its control, including third-party actions, system failures, or cyber-attacks.

## 7. Modification of Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Application after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. The latest version will always be available within the Application or on our website.

## 8. Governing Law & Jurisdiction
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

## 9. Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. 
We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Walrus agree that the Cayman Islands Arbitration Law governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and the Organization are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
